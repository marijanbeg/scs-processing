    "The code can be found in https://github.com/marijanbeg/scs-processing repository. To get it you can either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to your user directory and then run\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/marijanbeg/scs-processing.git\n",

    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy `scs-processing` directory from `usr/Shared` to your user directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, you can navigate to `scs-processing` and run everything from there. In `scs-processing` is `euxfel_scs_tools` directory where all the code lives. Code is not packaged because it will probably be merged to SCS ToolBox. Therefore, when you import (`import euxfel_scs_tools as scs`), this directory must be on the same path as the notebook you are running, unless you add a path (`import sys; sys.path.add('...')`)."
